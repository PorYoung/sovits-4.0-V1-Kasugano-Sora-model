# SoftVC VITS Singing Voice Conversion

In the field of Singing Voice Conversion, there is not only one project, SoVitsSvc, but also many other projects, which will not be listed here. The project was officially discontinued for maintenance and Archived.
However, there are still other enthusiasts who have created their own branches and continue to maintain the SoVitsSvc project (still unrelated to SvcDevelopTeam and the repository maintainers) and have made some big changes to it for you to find out for yourself.

#### ✨ A fork with a greatly improved interface: [34j/so-vits-svc-fork](https://github.com/34j/so-vits-svc-fork)

#### ✨ A client supports real-time conversion: [w-okada/voice-changer](https://github.com/w-okada/voice-changer)

#### This project is fundamentally different from Vits. Vits is TTS and this project is SVC. TTS cannot be carried out in this project, and Vits cannot carry out SVC, and the two project models are not universal

## 🆕 Update!

> Updated the 4.0-v2 model, the entire process is the same as 4.0. Compared to 4.0, there is some improvement in certain scenarios, but there are also some cases where it has regressed. Please refer to the [4.0-v2 branch](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/tree/4.0-v2) for more information.

## 📝 4.0 Feature list of branches

| Branch        |     Feature      |  whether compatible with the main branch model |
| :-------------: | :----------: | :------------:    |
| 4.0              |   main branch   |        -     |
| 4.0v2        |  The VISinger2 model is used  |        incompatibility     |
| 4.0-Vec768-Layer12    |  The feature input is the Layer 12 Transformer output of the Content Vec  |       incompatibility     |

## 📝 Model Introduction

The singing voice conversion model uses SoftVC content encoder to extract source audio speech features, then the vectors are directly fed into VITS instead of converting to a text based intermediate; thus the pitch and intonations are conserved. Additionally, the vocoder is changed to [NSF HiFiGAN](https://github.com/openvpi/DiffSinger/tree/refactor/modules/nsf_hifigan) to solve the problem of sound interruption.

### 🆕 4.0 Version Update Content

- Feature input is changed to [Content Vec](https://github.com/auspicious3000/contentvec)
- The sampling rate is unified to use 44100Hz
- Due to the change of hop size and other parameters, as well as the streamlining of some model structures, the required GPU memory for inference is **significantly reduced**. The 44kHz GPU memory usage of version 4.0 is even smaller than the 32kHz usage of version 3.0.
- Some code structures have been adjusted
- The dataset creation and training process are consistent with version 3.0, but the model is completely non-universal, and the data set needs to be fully pre-processed again.
- Added an option 1: automatic pitch prediction for vc mode, which means that you don't need to manually enter the pitch key when converting speech, and the pitch of male and female voices can be automatically converted. However, this mode will cause pitch shift when converting songs.
- Added option 2: reduce timbre leakage through k-means clustering scheme, making the timbre more similar to the target timbre.
- Added option 3: Added [NSF-HIFIGAN Enhancer](https://github.com/yxlllc/DDSP-SVC), which has certain sound quality enhancement effect on some models with few train-sets, but has negative effect on well-trained models, so it is closed by default

## 📊 Dataset Preparation

Simply place the dataset in the `dataset_raw` directory with the following file structure.

```
dataset_raw
├───speaker0
│   ├───xxx1-xxx1.wav
│   ├───...
│   └───Lxx-0xx8.wav
└───speaker1
    ├───xx2-0xxx2.wav
    ├───...
    └───xxx7-xxx007.wav
```

You can customize the speaker name.

```
dataset_raw
└───suijiSUI
    ├───1.wav
    ├───...
    └───25788785-20221210-200143-856_01_(Vocals)_0_0.wav
```

## 🛠️ Preprocessing

### 0. Slice audio

Slice to `5s - 15s`, a bit longer is no problem. Too long may lead to `torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError` during training or even pre-processing.

By using [audio-slicer-GUI](https://github.com/flutydeer/audio-slicer) or [audio-slicer-CLI](https://github.com/openvpi/audio-slicer)

In general, only the `Minimum Interval` needs to be adjusted. For statement audio it usually remains default. For singing audio it can be adjusted to `100` or even `50`.

After slicing, delete audio that is too long and too short.

### 1. Resample to 44100Hz and mono

```shell
python resample.py
```

### 2. Automatically split the dataset into training and validation sets, and generate configuration files.

```shell
python preprocess_flist_config.py
```

### 3. Generate hubert and f0

```shell
python preprocess_hubert_f0.py
```

After completing the above steps, the dataset directory will contain the preprocessed data, and the dataset_raw folder can be deleted.

#### You can modify some parameters in the generated config.json

* `keep_ckpts`: Keep the last `keep_ckpts` models during training. Set to `0` will keep them all. Default is `3`.

* `all_in_mem`: Load all dataset to RAM. It can be enabled when the disk IO of some platforms is too low and the system memory is **much larger** than your dataset.

## 🏋️‍♀️ Training

```shell
python train.py -c configs/config.json -m 44k
```

## 🤖 Inference

Use [inference_main.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/inference_main.py)

```shell
# Example
python inference_main.py -m "logs/44k/G_30400.pth" -c "configs/config.json" -s "nen" -n "君の知らない物語-src.wav" -t 0
```

Required parameters:
- `-m` | `--model_path`: Path to the model.
- `-c` | `--config_path`: Path to the configuration file.
- `-s` | `--spk_list`: Target speaker name for conversion.
- `-n` | `--clean_names`: A list of wav file names located in the raw folder.
- `-t` | `--trans`: Pitch adjustment, supports positive and negative (semitone) values.

Optional parameters: see the next section
- `-a` | `--auto_predict_f0`: Automatic pitch prediction for voice conversion. Do not enable this when converting songs as it can cause serious pitch issues.
- `-cl` | `--clip`: Voice forced slicing. Set to 0 to turn off(default), duration in seconds.
- `-lg` | `--linear_gradient`: The cross fade length of two audio slices in seconds. If there is a discontinuous voice after forced slicing, you can adjust this value. Otherwise, it is recommended to use. Default 0.
- `-cm` | `--cluster_model_path`: Path to the clustering model. Fill in any value if clustering is not trained.
- `-cr` | `--cluster_infer_ratio`: Proportion of the clustering solution, range 0-1. Fill in 0 if the clustering model is not trained.
- `-fmp` | `--f0_mean_pooling`: Apply mean filter (pooling) to f0, which may improve some hoarse sounds. Enabling this option will reduce inference speed.
- `-eh` | `--enhance`: Whether to use NSF_HIFIGAN enhancer. This option has certain effect on sound quality enhancement for some models with few training sets, but has negative effect on well-trained models, so it is turned off by default.

## 🤔 Optional Settings

If the results from the previous section are satisfactory, or if you didn't understand what is being discussed in the following section, you can skip it, and it won't affect the model usage. (These optional settings have a relatively small impact, and they may have some effect on certain specific data, but in most cases, the difference may not be noticeable.)

### Automatic f0 prediction

During the 4.0 model training, an f0 predictor is also trained, which can be used for automatic pitch prediction during voice conversion. However, if the effect is not good, manual pitch prediction can be used instead. But please do not enable this feature when converting singing voice as it may cause serious pitch shifting!
- Set `auto_predict_f0` to true in inference_main.

### Cluster-based timbre leakage control

Introduction: The clustering scheme can reduce timbre leakage and make the trained model sound more like the target's timbre (although this effect is not very obvious), but using clustering alone will lower the model's clarity (the model may sound unclear). Therefore, this model adopts a fusion method to linearly control the proportion of clustering and non-clustering schemes. In other words, you can manually adjust the ratio between "sounding like the target's timbre" and "being clear and articulate" to find a suitable trade-off point.

The existing steps before clustering do not need to be changed. All you need to do is to train an additional clustering model, which has a relatively low training cost.

- Training process:
  - Train on a machine with good CPU performance. According to my experience, it takes about 4 minutes to train each speaker on a Tencent Cloud machine with 6-core CPU.
  - Execute `python cluster/train_cluster.py`. The output model will be saved in `logs/44k/kmeans_10000.pt`.
- Inference process:
  - Specify `cluster_model_path` in `inference_main.py`.
  - Specify `cluster_infer_ratio` in `inference_main.py`, where `0` means not using clustering at all, `1` means only using clustering, and usually `0.5` is sufficient.

### F0 mean filtering

Introduction: The mean filtering of F0 can effectively reduce the hoarse sound caused by the predicted fluctuation of pitch (the hoarse sound caused by reverb or harmony can not be eliminated temporarily). This function has been greatly improved on some songs. However, some songs are out of tune. If the song appears dumb after reasoning, it can be considered to open.

- Set `f0_mean_pooling` to true in `inference_main.py`

## 📤 Exporting to Onnx

Use [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py)

- Create a folder named `checkpoints` and open it
- Create a folder in the `checkpoints` folder as your project folder, naming it after your project, for example `aziplayer`
- Rename your model as `model.pth`, the configuration file as `config.json`, and place them in the `aziplayer` folder you just created
- Modify `"NyaruTaffy"` in `path = "NyaruTaffy"` in [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py) to your project name, `path = "aziplayer"`
- Run [onnx_export.py](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc/blob/4.0/onnx_export.py)
- Wait for it to finish running. A `model.onnx` will be generated in your project folder, which is the exported model.

### UI support for Onnx models

- [MoeSS](https://github.com/NaruseMioShirakana/MoeSS)
  - [Hubert4.0](https://huggingface.co/NaruseMioShirakana/MoeSS-SUBModel)

Note: For Hubert Onnx models, please use the models provided by MoeSS. Currently, they cannot be exported on their own (Hubert in fairseq has many unsupported operators and things involving constants that can cause errors or result in problems with the input/output shape and results when exported.)

CppDataProcess are some functions to preprocess data used in MoeSS
